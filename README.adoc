:description: Exploring the idea of a lunchtime algorithm club, comparing implementations of common algorithms.

Some sketches to see if there is value in comparing object-oriented or procedural implementations of common algorithms with funcional ones,
and/or diving into implementation efficiency.

Format -- a lunchtime meet-up for the office.
One algorithm per session.
